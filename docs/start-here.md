# Getting Started with a Project Flow

Welcome to the repository of this Next.js project! In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to set up your development environment, install Node.js and PNPM, and run the Next.js project. We'll keep it beginner-friendly and make sure you don't miss any important steps.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

1. **Node.js**: To run JavaScript code and manage packages.
2. **PNPM**: A package manager that we'll use for this project.

### Step 1: Install Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that's essential for running your Next.js project. Follow these steps to install it:

#### For Windows:

1. Visit the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Download the LTS (Long-Term Support) version.
3. Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.

#### For macOS:

1. You can use Homebrew to install Node.js. Open your terminal and run:

   ```
   brew install node
   ```

#### For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):

1. Open your terminal and run the following commands:

   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nodejs
   ```

2. Verify the installation by running:

   ```
   node -v
   ```

This should display the version of Node.js installed on your system.

### Step 2: Install PNPM

We'll use PNPM as our package manager for this project. PNPM is a fast, disk-space-efficient package manager.

1. To install PNPM globally, open your terminal and run:

   ```
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```

2. Verify the installation by running:

   ```
   pnpm -v
   ```

This should display the version of PNPM installed on your system.

## Running the Next.js Project

Now that you have Node.js and PNPM installed, you can run the Next.js project. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   Use `git` or download the project repository to your computer.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   Open your terminal and navigate to the project folder using the `cd` command:

   ```
   cd /path/to/your/project-folder
   ```

3. **Install Project Dependencies**:

   In the project folder, run:

   ```
   pnpm install
   ```

   This will install all the project's dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.

4. **Start the Development Server**:

   Once the dependencies are installed, run:

   ```
   pnpm dev
   ```

   This command starts the Next.js development server. After it's up and running, you should see a message like "Ready on http://localhost:3000" in your terminal.

5. **Access the Project in Your Browser**:

   Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the running Next.js project.

That's it! You're now ready to work on and explore this Next.js project. If you have any issues or questions, don't hesitate to reach out for help. Good luck, and happy coding!
